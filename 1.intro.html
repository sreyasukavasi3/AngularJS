In order to get started with Angular JS, you need to have knowledge on HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
Mi≈°ko Hevery, a Google employee, started to work with AngularJS in 2009.
AngularJS is a JavaScript framework. It is a library written in JavaScript.
AngularJS is distributed as a JavaScript file, and can be added to a web page with a script tag:
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.9/angular.min.js"></script>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.9/angular.min.js"></script>
<body>

<div ng-app="">
  <p>Name: <input type="text" ng-model="name"></p>
  <p ng-bind="name"></p>
</div>

</body>
</html>
Explanation of the above code:
AngularJS starts automatically when the web page has loaded.
The ng-app directive tells AngularJS that the <div> element is the "owner" of an AngularJS application.
The ng-model directive binds the value of the input field to the application variable name.
The ng-bind directive binds the content of the <p> element to the application variable name.
